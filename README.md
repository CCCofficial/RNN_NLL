# A deep learning model for analyzing noisy biological systems
# This project uses deep learning to map the varying input conditions (growth rate, degradation rate, transcription/translation rate, ect.) to the conditional probability distributions of the observations. 
# The conditional probability distribution is automatically generated by the deep learning algorithms with the help of negative log likelihood loss function. This is the state-of-art since it does not require pre-assumption of the distribution (previous work all needs to pre-assume a gaussian, exponential or other distribution). During the training process, as few as one noisy data is needed per input condition.
